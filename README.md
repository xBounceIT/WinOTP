## Project Structure

- `/api` - API endpoints and interfaces
- `/core` - Core application logic
- `/models` - Data models and schemas
- `/static` - Static assets and resources
- `/tests` - Test suite
- `/ui` - User interface components
  - `/pages` - Separate HTML pages for each screen of the application
  - `/static` - CSS, JavaScript, and other UI-related static files
- `/utils` - Utility functions and helpers

## Configuration

By default, the application stores its configuration and data files in the user's Documents folder:
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WinOTP`

The main files are:

- `auth_config.json` - Authentication configuration (PIN/password hashes, timeout settings).
- `app_settings.json` - Application settings (e.g., minimize to tray).
- `tokens.json` - Token storage. Encrypted if app protection is enabled. **Do not edit this file manually.**

**Note:** When running in debug mode (using the `--debug` or `-d` flag), the application will instead use local files named `tokens.json.dev`, `app_settings.json.dev`, and `auth_config.json.dev` located in the application's root directory.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

Test coverage reports can be found in the `.coverage` file.

### Development Environment

The project includes configuration files for VS Code in the `.vscode` directory.

## Security

- All tokens are encrypted at rest using strong cryptography
- No cloud storage or network transmission of tokens
- Local-only storage with secure encryption
