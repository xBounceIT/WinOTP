# WinOTP Static Assets

This folder contains static assets for the WinOTP application.

## Images

The following icons are needed in the `/static/images/` directory:

- `search.png` - Icon for the search button (16x16 pixels recommended)
- `plus.png` - Icon for the add token button (16x16 pixels recommended)
- `settings.png` - Icon for the settings button (16x16 pixels recommended)
- `qr_code.png` - Icon for the QR code scanning option (32x32 pixels recommended)
- `manual_entry.png` - Icon for the manual entry option (32x32 pixels recommended)
- `back_arrow.png` - Icon for the back button (24x24 pixels recommended)

### Icon Requirements

1. All icons should be PNG format with transparency
2. Icons should be created at the recommended sizes or larger
3. Icons should have good contrast against dark backgrounds (the app uses a dark theme)
4. Simple, clear designs work best for small icon sizes

If any icons are missing, the application will fall back to text representations.
